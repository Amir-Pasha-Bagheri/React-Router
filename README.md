In this project you can see three of my works such as :

1- Calculator (Wirtten by React js):
  you can use  +,-,*,/ operators

2-very basic Shopping Cart (Written by Redux)
  you can add items in your shopping cart and manage their amount

3-Exam (Written by React js and Redux)
  3 optional questions wich you can answer them and at the end you will notice your mark and green or red text will tell you that you passed the exam or you failed

wich you can switch between these projects by REACT ROUTER
Hope You Like It !!!
